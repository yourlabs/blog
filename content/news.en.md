# Traefik online meetup by James PIC

How weak is a Continuous Deployment when you can't just deploy the master branch to production at any time? Merging unfinished patches to publish them on a staging deployment blocks production deployment of the master branch. eXtreme DevOps is the practice of an extremely aggressive Continuous Delivery strategy where each patch push deploys an ephemeral deployment such as branchname.ci.example.com. Of course, this would be quite hard to achieve with configuration files, even with NGINX and Ansible. But, with Traefik it becomes so easy that I couldn't resist and make it the standard practice for all our customers, from private companies of all sizes, and to government organizations. In this session, James demos and discusses his expertise using Traefik to practice eXtreme DevOps for his customers.
