Nothing is safe from hacking: from password hacking to shellcode injection written for a specific occasion,
social engineering adding the famous "Chair to keyboard interface" , all means are
good for escalating from privilege 0 to vital resources for
the company. 
Cyber defense is an essential subject for all companies and services 
that deal with private information.

## Punctual and continuous security audits

YourLabs Security Service offers a catalog of services in
constantly evolving 
accessible in the form of specific missions for justify an obligation of means 
against cyber criminals up to the continuous surveillance against other threats to your
business.

## Services


** Personalized written report ** certifying levels of risk from
detected vulnerabilities, 
with a strategic report for a half-day decision maker on optional site.

** In-house training ** to cultivate the security mindset in a
friendly setting and a fun atmosphere, in an [local hacker] (https://www.meetup.com/Angouleme-Hack-Dev-Barcamp-1337/) aestetic .

## Audit and counter-audit report

The blackbox ** audit report ** analyzes the results and determines the level of
risk (score out of 10) of each penetration vector.

A ** counter-audit report ** is offered for each service from
â‚¬ 4,250, it serves as proof certifying that the documented vulnerabilities in the
* audit report * are well corrected.


## Blackbox audit

** The "blackbox" audit ** scans your public area with specialized tools in networking and protocols (HTTP, DNS, SSH, ...)
exposed on the public network (internet).

** The goal ** of such an audit is to ** identify the attack vectors **
across the public network and geographic area (internet, public places)
before a malicious hacker exploits them in the context of ** remote attacks ** and [operations
gadget infiltration] (https://gitpitch.com/yourlabs/security).

### Depth limitation warning

The blackbox audit excludes further research from separate targets:

- static analysis of source code (whitebox)
- non-public thick client (mobile app, windows ...)
- maintenance infrastructures for third parties who do not have
given their prior written agreement in writing (customers, service providers,
public services ...)
- Phisical intrusion (night and day time)
- phishing 
- ...

## Whitebox audit

The ** whitebox audit ** is typically carried out in the second phase, going through
static analysis of source code and dependencies, and helps to guard against
more difficult vulnerabilities but not impossible to see in blackbox.

## Full pentest audit

The ** full pentest audit ** applies the results of black and white boxe audit,
allowing the company to test in real situations the risks of infiltration, 
data exfiltration, malware installations, cookies to intercept or even modify the network on the fly,
master certificates injection on fixed stations to betray protocols ciphers (https..), 
through high-flying tactics without breaking and entering:
access badge hacking, lockpicking: doors, hard drive bay or
server rack, escalation, neutralization of alarms, cameras and all kind of detectors,
, identity or function theft ...

The ** full pentest audit ** is the best way for the company to see
and fixe the security loopholes discovered at all levels.
