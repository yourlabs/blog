James Pic, also known as "jpic", "is_null", and "1337shadow", started coding in
1995, counts hundreds of Open Source contributions including to major projects
such as Python, Django and Ansible, also credited in some Arch Linux packages,
and maintains more than 50 Open Source packages on both the Python and the Node
package indexes.

James claims that you will not find anyone who loves bugs more than he does,
which he proves by spending a crazy amount of time fixing other people problem
for free on StackOverflow (where he is top 0.1% all-time) and on IRC or mailing
lists, often anonymously. He claims for excuse that just like you would spend
part of your time solving chess problems if you want to be Grand Master one
day, and that helping others with their problems is an important part of his
training. This makes James an amazing go-to "flying doctor" to have on call.
