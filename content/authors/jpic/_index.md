James was playing too much computer games, that's probably what his uncle thought when he sat next to him at the age of 9 with "The Bible of C Programing" to drive him through writing his first computer program. But it's only at the age of 14 at school that James was asked for one of his program by another Human being, and that's how he figured he would be making a living out of coding. 20 years later James not only contributes to Open Source Software, but also maintains countless programs. Living in his hackerspace with other 1337 haxors sharing a passion for code, where they host a weekly "Hack & Dev" meetup starting with beer and ending with live music, with the barbecue and cooking action going on during the talks.
