Keeping your inbox clean can be quite a pain. Except with keyboard shortcuts.

- `?` shows the list of shortcuts,
- `/` to search mails,
- `c` to compose a message,
- `gi` brings you to the inbox,
- `j` and `k` moves the little blue cursor between threads,
- `x` selects the thread that has the blue cursor,
- `e` archives selected threads,
- `o` opens selected thread
- `a` is for reply **to all**,
- `r` is for reply.

That's it !
