Very happy with GitLab-CI ! However Vagrant/VirtualBox are givin me false positives on high load some times ... so we're starting an r&amp;d; project to do a Vagrant in Python but just for LibVirt and with the purpose of eXtreme performance & stability for development and of course CI as first class citizen ! Interested ? let us know ;) With LOVE
