If you're unhappy with the current state of your setup.py, you should definitely try [setupmeta](https://github.com/zsimic/setupmeta) by famous haxor [Zoran Simic](https://github.com/zsimic). I've been upgrading my setup.py to setupmeta, which gives me 10 times more useful features than the crappy script I had in my delivery pipelines, and I'm going directly with setupmeta for all new packages. So far, we have at least the following packages with setupmeta (probably more): \- [cli2](https://yourlabs.io/oss/cli2) \- [shyml](https://yourlabs.io/oss/shyml) \- [djcli](https://yourlabs.io/oss/djcli) \- [crudlfap](https://yourlabs.io/oss/crudlfap) \- [playlabs](https://yourlabs.io/oss/playlabs) Even if you don't maintain python packages, I highly recommend that you check [setupmeta](https://github.com/zsimic/setupmeta) because it's really well thought of. Have a great day ;)
