<p>Hi, I'm a uni student who is in internship. I'm currently working with django.</p>
<p>I want to use django-autocomplete-light, but I have some problems. I've already written a view for a template and i want to implement the autocomplete in the template. Is it possible? Should I write a new view?</p>
<p>I also saw that some people wrote a file which is autocomplete_light_registry.py but it isn't mentionned in your doc. Is it not necessary anymore?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ps: I'm sorry for my English mistakes</p>
