As you know, YBS is commited to contribute to defending OSS and OSS hackers.

As this becomes more and more visible, I am pleased to announce today that we
are now sponsoring famous Open Source hackers:

- [Eric Steven Raymond](http://www.catb.org/~esr/)
- [Ned Batchelder](http://nedbatchelder.com)
- [Derick Rethans](https://derickrethans.nl/)
- [Jannis Leidel](https://github.com/jezdez)

Thank you all deeply for your contributions.

They complete the long list of YBS sponsors, which I hope to centralize
somewhere one day :)

Have a great day

J
