Nowadays, virtualenv uses ``--no-site-packages`` by default. This means that
the created virtualenv will not access global site-packages modules ie.
``/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/``.

To enable global site-packages again, just remove this file::

    your_env/lib/python2.7/no-global-site-packages.txt

Why would you do that ?

Some modules are complicated to install (xpyb) or take too much time to compile
(pyqt). Using the distro packages can be pretty useful !
