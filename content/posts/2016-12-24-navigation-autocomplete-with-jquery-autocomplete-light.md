"How to make a navigation autocomplete with django-autocomplete-light v3" seems like a top FAQ since v3 release, because v2 included an [example](http://django-autocomplete-light.readthedocs.io/en/v2/navigation.html) which was not reported inside the documentation of [v3](http://django-autocomplete-light.readthedocs.io/).

While the example in v2 documentation is still valid, the autocomplete.js script was removed from django-autocomplete-light, and is now available in the [jquery-autocomplete-light repository](https://github.com/yourlabs/jquery-autocomplete-light/blob/master/src/autocomplete.js).

Happy hollidays from the YourLabs panarchy :)
