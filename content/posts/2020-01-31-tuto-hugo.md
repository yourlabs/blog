[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/about/) 0.63.1 is a fast CMS / Framework based on the "GO" language, static site generator.
Fast because when content is changed it instantly re-builds the content.

<!--more-->

The template engine is derived from "Jinja", you must know its syntax to create your own templates:

    - Display a variable: {{ .title }} ou {{ $my_var }}.
    - Execute a function:  {{ seq 1 5 }}.
    - conditions: {{ if CONDITION }} ... {{ end }}.
    - Inclusions: {{ partial "<PATH>/<PARTIAL>.<EXTENSION>" . }}

**hugo advantages**

- It natively integrates a SASS / SCSS compiler.

```
{{ $style := resources.Get "sass/main.scss | resources.toCSS }}
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ $style.Permalink }}">
```
- Also a CSS, JS, JSON, HTML, SVG and XML minifier.

```
{{ $css := resources.Get "css/main.css" }}
{{ style := $css | resources.Minify }}
```
- And an asset building.

```
{{ $plugins := resources.Get "js/plugins.js" }}
{{ $global := resources.Get "js/global.js" }}
{{ $js := slice $plugins $global | resources.Concat "js/bundle.js" }}
```
**Création of a first site**

- We will create a new Hugo site in a folder named first_site.
```
hugo new site first_site
```
- Add a theme for the site. You can see a list of themes on [themes.gohugo.io](https://themes.gohugo.io/).Here we use Ananke theme.

- First, download the theme from Github and add it to your site’s theme directory:

```
cd first_site
git init
git submodule add https://github.com/budparr/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke
```

- Then, add the theme to the site configuration:

```
echo 'theme = "ananke"' >> config.toml
```

- To create a first post, use the new command to do few things for you (like add title and date), you can manually modify metadata:

```
hugo new posts/my-first-post.md
```

- Edit the newly created content file if you want, it will start with something like this:

```
---
title: "My First Post"
date: 2019-03-26T08:47:11+01:00
draft: true
---
```

- Now, start the Hugo server with drafts enabled:

```
hugo server -D
