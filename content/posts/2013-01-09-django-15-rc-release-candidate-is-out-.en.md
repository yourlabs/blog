Django core hackers [announced 1.5 release candidate](https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2013/jan/04/15-rc-1/).

This means that the [1.5 release notes](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/1.5/) are rather stable by now, the chances that they change is insignificant.

Wait for the final 1.5.0 release before migrating projects in production thought... Read [more about what release candidate are](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Release_candidate).

Thanks to the Django core team and community for this awesome release !
