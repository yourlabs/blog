It's been [a few days](https://github.com/jpic/dotfiles/commit/8a87b03304afe783fffea6c2d937c92054b734b0) since I'm using [jedi auto complete](https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi)  for [vim](http://github.com/davidhalter/jedi-vim), but for now all I can say is that it's highly recommendable.

It's not perfect of course, particularly when it comes to autocompleting `self.`, but still, it's a great addition to [python-mode](https://github.com/klen/python-mode).
