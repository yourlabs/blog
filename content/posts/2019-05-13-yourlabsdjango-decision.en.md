A Delegative Democracy implementation made in [BlackLoop HackerSpace](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kangoulya/15162026009) for Les Indign√©s back in the days I used to squatt hackerspaces in-between gigs (now running my own). It's a bit old but probably still valid, given the complexity is handled in SQL with a [WITH RECURSIVE](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/queries-with.html) query. Anyway, hope this will inspire you ! Have a great week
