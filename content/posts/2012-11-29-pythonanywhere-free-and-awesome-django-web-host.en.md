Here's a really cool contribution. Harry Percival [emailed django-developers](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!searchin/django-developers/pythonanywhere/django-developers/CIMrDCddIBc/h6XZT7_QucIJ) about his employer, [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/):

> We do offer Django hosting as part of our Free plan, so it's a nice place for people to  come and try out Django, for free, maybe host a prototype web app...

I registered to give it a tried and received an amazing welcome email, which I won't spoil for you !
