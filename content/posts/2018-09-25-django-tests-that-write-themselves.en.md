This is a plain advertisement for two excellent test utils maintained by YourLabs:

- [django-dbdiff](https://github.com/yourlabs/django-dbdiff)
- [django-responsediff](https://github.com/yourlabs/django-responsediff)

If you're volunteering on a project, and that there are many newbie contributors - who turn out to be militants with a high determination - then you definitively want to check out these apps as they will highly facilitate your volunteering in a project as sole professional dev.
