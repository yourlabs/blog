[Markus Holtermann](https://github.com/MarkusH) has published a [tutorial for setting up syntax highlighting for Django's SQL query logging](https://markusholtermann.eu/2016/01/syntax-highlighting-for-djangos-sql-query-logging/). I didn't try it but it looks pretty cool, maybe that's something we could add to [django-dbdiff](https://github.com/yourlabs/django-dbdiff) somehow. Anyway, check it out !
