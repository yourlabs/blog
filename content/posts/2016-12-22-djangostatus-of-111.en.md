Django 1.11 alpha is [announced](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/django-developers/nWk5Hoi6X6M) for January 16, review priority will be given to any ticket marked "ready for checkin" by January 9, Tim says, which means its still time to make a contribution to Django 1.11 !

> The only "major feature" on the [1.11 roadmap](https://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/Version1.11Roadmap) is template-based widget re
ndering which is (hopefully) in [final reviews](https://github.com/django/django/pull/6498). There are still plenty of
 ["patches needing review"](https://code.djangoproject.com/query?status=!closed&needs_better_patch=0&needs_tests=0&needs_docs=0&has_patch=1&stage=Accepted) if you want to help there.
 
My personnal advice ? Try to do even just a small contribution or try to help reviewing, it's still time ;)
